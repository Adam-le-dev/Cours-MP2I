## British daily quality newspapers
These newspapers feature quality reporting and, frequently, in-depth articles.
They generally separate information articles from opinion articles.

### The Times
Politically conservative right-wing; the oldest British newspaper, founded in
1785 under the name Daily Universal Register (renamed The Times in 1788). It is
owned by press baron Rupert Murdoch and reading requires a paywall. Its Sunday
edition is called The Sunday Times.

### The Daily Telegraph
Right-wing, so aligned with the conservatives that it is sometimes called the
"Torygraph". Boris Johnson started off there as a journalist. The Sunday
Telegraph now refers to the same paper (since 2013).
Owned my Frederick Barclay.

### The Guardian
Left-wing, pro-labour most of the time. Offers a wealth of free online contents,
relying on voluntary donations and on subscriptions. It started off as The
Manchester Guardian in 1821 and became The Guardian in 1959. It frequently opens
its columns to Labour politicians, or activists. The Sunday edition is called
"The Observer".

### The independent
Center-left, now only online and leans a bit more in the tabloids.

## British quality magazines (weeklies)
### The Economist
Politically liberal right-wing, both liberal and liberalist. Initially
anti-Brexit. It is published all around the world, with multiple editions for
the UK, Europe and the USA. Strongly political editorial line.

### The New Statesman
Left-wing weekly. Real left-wing.

### The Spectator
Right-wing weekly. The former editor in chief was Boris Johnson. Lightly conservative,
though originally left-wing liberal. Oldest magazine of the world.
Owned my Frederick Barclay.

### Private Eye
(Every fortnight) A satirical magazine, perhaps the closest to the "Canard
Enchaîné".

## British Tabloids
Much more read than the ones in France, and complete articles. Sometimes called
"gutter press" or "red tops", they almost never separate information and
opinion, and feature big pictures, sports coverage, people articles.
They are mostly daily papers, that are read every day.

### The Sun
Politically right-wing, usually supportive of conservative governments (with an
exception for Tony Blair), strongly pro-Brexit. Featured topless women on the
infamous page 3 until 2015.
Owned by Rupert Murdoch.

### The Daily Mail
Politically right-wing, the "most respectable" tabloid, with better quality
reporting.
Owned by Rupert Murdoch.

### The Daily Express
Politically left-wing, strongly pro-Brexit.

### The Daily Star
Politically right-wing.

### The Daily Mirror
Politically left-wing, strongly pro-Labour, the only left-wing tabloid with the
Morning Star (another publication focused on social and trade union issues).

## The BBC
The British Broadcasting Company (also called "The Beeb"), a public service
media of the state, set up since 1922. A major founder was John Reith. This
media's existence is threatened, with the conservatives that want to remove it.
It was recognized for a long time for its role in war-time morale, impartiality
and fairness, great prestige and role in British Media for the long time it was
a state monopoly.

It is now criticized and accused of bias against the Brexit, especially by the
conservative party.

The BBC is paid by English taxes, and free of access, for its website, its TV,
and its radio.

## A major media mogul : Rupert Murdoch
His group, News Corp., owns almost half of the English-speaking media, in
Television (Sky and Fox News), newspapers ... His ties with politicians and his
influence on politics makes him a Kingmaker, a bit too close to many elected
politicians.
He can me compared to Bolloré in France, but his influence is much more
widespread and even more direct on politics.

## American newspapers
### The New York Times
Liberal left-wing newspaper. Founded in 1851, it won the most Pulitzer Prizes.
Known as the "Gray lady".

### The Wall Street Journal (WSJ)
Founded in 1889 by Charles Bergstresser, Charles Dow and Edward Jones, bought in 2007.
Leading daily financial paper, described as "small-c [conservative]", and noted
that its readership leans further in the right.

and has a daily readership of approximately 350,000. It now belongs to Jeff
Bezos' holding company, Nash Holdings.

Against Trump, liberal, almost leans in the American left-wing.

universities, private groups and donations.
